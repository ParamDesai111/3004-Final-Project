Register New User and Add Profile

---

Purpose

The sequence diagram illustrates the process of registering a new user and creating a profile in the application.

---

Actors and Objects

MainWindow: Acts as the main interface for user interaction, responsible for triggering the user and profile creation process.

User: Represents a user in the system, holding email, password, and associated profiles.

Profile: Represents an individual user profile with attributes such as name, gender, weight, height, and date of birth.

Flow Step-by-Step

Page Display for Profile Creation:
-MainWindow invokes showCreateProfilePage(), directing the user to the profile creation interface.

Saving a New Profile:
-When the user provides the necessary details and submits the form, saveProfile() is called in MainWindow.

User Creation:
-An alt fragment checks if a currentUser exists:
    -If currentUser is null, a new User object is created with the provided email and password.
    -The newly created User is stored in currentUser.

Profile Creation:
-A Profile object is instantiated using the provided name, gender, weight, height, and date of birth.

Associating Profile with User:
-The addProfile(newProfile) method in User is called to associate the newly created profile with the current user.

Updating Profile List:
-The updateProfilesList() method in MainWindow refreshes the list of profiles displayed to the user.

Retrieving Profiles:
-getProfiles() is invoked to fetch the list of profiles associated with the current user.

Displaying Profile Details:
-A loop fragment iterates over each profile, invoking methods like:
    -getEmail() to retrieve the user's email.
    -getName() to fetch the profile name.
    -getGender() to display the profile's gender.
    -getWeight(), getHeight(), and getDateOfBirth() to retrieve additional profile attributes.

Key Interactions

User Creation: A new User object is instantiated only if the user does not already exist. The email and password are validated before proceeding​.

Profile Creation: A new Profile object is created and added to the user using addProfile()​.

UI Updates: updateProfilesList() in MainWindow ensures that the UI reflects the latest changes to the profile list.

Outcome

-A new user is created (if not already existing).
-A new profile is associated with the user.
-The updated list of profiles is displayed, allowing further interaction.
