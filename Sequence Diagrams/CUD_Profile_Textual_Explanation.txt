Create, Update, Delete Profile (Existing User)

---

Purpose

This sequence diagram illustrates the creation, update, and deletion of a profile for an existing user.

---

Actors and Objects

MainWindow: 
-Provides the user interface for managing profiles.
-Facilitates navigation to profile management pages and triggers operations for creating, updating, and deleting profiles.

User: Represents an application user and holds their credentials and associated profiles.

Profile: Stores individual profile data such as name, gender, weight, height, and date of birth.

---

Flow Step-by-Step

Displaying Profile Management Page:
-The showProfilePage() method in MainWindow displays the profile management page.

Navigating to Profile Creation Page:
-If the user opts to create a new profile, goToCreateProfilePage() is called, directing the user to the profile creation form.

Creating a New Profile:
-The user provides input, and saveProfile() is invoked.
-A new Profile object is created using the provided details (name, gender, weight, height, and dob).
-addProfile(newProfile) associates the new profile with the User.
-The updated profile list is displayed via updateProfilesList().

Updating a Profile:
-The viewProfile() method displays details of the selected profile, and allows the user to make changes.
-When submit button is clicked, editProfile() is called.
-Profile attributes (name, gender, weight, height, and dob) are updated using respective setter methods (setName, setGender, etc.).
-The updated profile list is displayed via updateProfilesList().

Deleting a Profile:
-The user selects a profile to delete, and deleteProfile() is invoked.
-A loop iterates through profiles to find the matching one based on getName().
-The profile is removed using removeAt(i), and setProfiles(updatedProfiles) updates the list of profiles for the user.
-The updated profile list is displayed via updateProfilesList().

---

Key Interactions

Profile Viewing: getProfiles() retrieves all profiles for the logged-in user, and getName() identifies specific profiles.

Profile Creation: A Profile object is instantiated, and addProfile() associates it with the current userâ€‹.

Profile Editing: Attributes of the Profile object are updated using setter methods (setName, setGender, etc.), ensuring data consistency.

Profile Deletion: Profiles are identified using getName() and removed with removeAt(i).

---

Outcome

-Users can create, update, and delete profiles seamlessly.
-The system dynamically reflects changes in the UI via updateProfilesList().
-Profiles remain consistent with the user data and are accessible for further actions.
