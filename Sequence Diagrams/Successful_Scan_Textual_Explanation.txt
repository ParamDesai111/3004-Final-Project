Successful Scan

---

Purpose

The sequence diagram demonstrates the process of performing a successful scan using the RaDoTechDevice. The process includes pairing the device, initiating a scan, processing collected data, and transitioning through the scan points until the scan completes.

Actors and Objects

MainWindow: The main interface for interacting with the user and orchestrating the scanning process.
User: Represents the current logged-in user with associated profiles.
Profile: Stores individual user profiles, enabling scans to be linked to a specific profile.
RaDoTechDevice: Represents the scanning device used to collect health data.
Battery: Manages the device's battery, ensuring sufficient charge for the scan.
DataProcessor: Processes the raw data collected during the scan, producing results for analysis.

Flow Step-by-Step

Starting the Scan:
-The user navigates to the scan page via showMeasureNowPage().

Selecting a Profile:
-startScan() retrieves profiles using getProfiles() and displays them.
-The user selects a profile using getName().

Device Setup:
-The user navigates to the device view using showDeviceView().
-The device is paired via PairUp().

Performing the Scan:
-For each scan point, the following user’s actions loop until all scan points have been completed (currentScanPoint == totalScanPoints)
    -performDeviceScan() checks if the device is paired using getIsPaired() and initiates the scan via startScan().
    -The battery level is verified using getBatteryLevel().
    -Raw data is collected using collectData(), and the device depletes its battery via depleteBattery().

Processing Data:
-If the scan on the skin has completed successfully after being held for 5 seconds (scantimercomplete && !scanTimer->isActive())
    -Collected data is set in the DataProcessor using setRawData().
    -Data is validated via validateData() and processed using processData().
    -The processed data is displayed using showMeasureView().

Completing the Scan:
-After completing all scan points, the process transitions to the personal information page via showPersonalInfoPage().

Key Interactions

Device Pairing: The device must be paired before scanning begins using PairUp()​(RaDoTechDevice).

Battery Management: Battery operations are monitored using getBatteryLevel() and isLow() methods from the Battery class​.

Data Collection: RaDoTechDevice collects raw data during each scan point using collectData() and tracks battery depletion​.

Data Processing: DataProcessor validates and processes raw data into meaningful results, using setRawData() and processData().

UI Updates: MainWindow transitions between pages, updates the progress, and displays results dynamically.

Outcome

The process concludes with the successful completion of all scan points, presenting processed health data and transitioning to a summary page for further review.
