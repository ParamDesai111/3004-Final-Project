# Functional Health Indicators Calculations

## 1. Energy Level
Energy Level is the average of Φ Left (Φ L) and Φ Right (Φ R).
Formula:
    Energy Level = (Φ L + Φ R) / 2
Classification Ranges:
    - Normal: 50 to 70
    - Below Normal: < 50
    - Above Normal: > 70

## 2. Immune System
Immune system performance is determined by the Upper Avg (average of all upper-body meridians: H1-H6, Left and Right).
Formula:
    Upper Avg = (Sum of H1-H6 (Left) + Sum of H1-H6 (Right)) / 6
Classification Ranges:
    - Normal: 60 to 80
    - Below Normal: < 60
    - Above Normal: > 80

## 3. Metabolism
Metabolism is based on the L/R Ratio (ratio of total energy on the left vs right sides).
Formula:
    L/R Ratio = Φ L / Φ R
Classification Ranges:
    - Normal: 0.9 to 1.1
    - Below Normal: < 0.9
    - Above Normal: > 1.1

## 4. Psycho-Emotional State
Psycho-emotional state is derived from key meridians linked to emotional balance (e.g., H1 and H2 for Heart and Pericardium).
Formula:
    Psycho-Emotional State = (H1 (Left) + H1 (Right) + H2 (Left) + H2 (Right)) / 4
Classification Ranges:
    - Normal: 0.8 to 1.0
    - Below Normal: < 0.8
    - Above Normal: > 1.0

## 5. Musculoskeletal System
Musculoskeletal health is determined by the Lower Avg (average of all lower-body meridians: F1-F6, Left and Right).
Formula:
    Lower Avg = (Sum of F1-F6 (Left) + Sum of F1-F6 (Right)) / 6
Classification Ranges:
    - Normal: 60 to 80
    - Below Normal: < 60
    - Above Normal: > 80

# Professional Practitioner Data Calculations

## 1. Average Value
The overall average of all meridian conductance measurements.
Formula:
    Average Value = (Sum of all Left Side measurements + Sum of all Right Side measurements) / Total Number of Measurements

## 2. Left and Right Side Totals
Formulas:
    Φ L = Sum of all Left Side Measurements
    Φ R = Sum of all Right Side Measurements

## 3. Left/Right Ratio (L/R Ratio)
Measures balance of conductance between left and right sides.
Formula:
    L/R Ratio = Φ L / Φ R
Classification Ranges:
    - Normal: 0.9 to 1.1
    - Below Normal: < 0.9
    - Above Normal: > 1.1

## 4. Upper and Lower Body Totals
Formulas:
    Upper Total = Sum of H1-H6 (Left) + Sum of H1-H6 (Right)
    Lower Total = Sum of F1-F6 (Left) + Sum of F1-F6 (Right)

## 5. Upper/Lower Ratio (Up/Low Ratio)
Measures balance of energy levels between upper and lower body.
Formula:
    Up/Low Ratio = Upper Total / Lower Total
Classification Ranges:
    - Normal: 0.9 to 1.2
    - Below Normal: < 0.9
    - Above Normal: > 1.2

## 6. Individual Points
Specific readings for individual meridians (e.g., L2, L1, H1, H2). No additional calculations required.

## 7. Norm Deviation for Specific Metrics
For practitioners, any deviations are flagged based on thresholds:
    - L/R Ratio: 0.9 ≤ L/R ≤ 1.1
    - Up/Low Ratio: 0.9 ≤ Up/Low ≤ 1.2
    - Upper and Lower Averages: 60 ≤ Avg ≤ 80
