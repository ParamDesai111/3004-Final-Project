Closed State:
    - This is the initial state when the RaDoTech app is not running. We included this state to capture the app's
      lifecycle and user interaction.

    - The transitions to "Login" or "Register" are based on whether the user has an account, ensuring a clear 
      pathway for user interaction.

Login State:
    - This state handles user authentication. We included it because this is the initial state to enter the app if
      the user has an account. 

    - Transition to "Error" handles failed login attempts, while successful login transitions to "Home Page," 
      reflecting the natural flow of user actions.

Register State:
    - This state allows new users to create an account. We included it to ensure the app can accommodate new users.

    - Similar to "Login," transitions handle success or error conditions, ensuring users can retry if their input is invalid.

Home Page State:
    - This is the central hub where users access all app features. We chose to include this state to provide a clear and 
      organized structure for user interaction.

    - Transitions to "Scan Preparation," "Scan History," and "Profiles" allow users to navigate to different functionalities. 

Scan Preparation State:
    - This state prepares the user for a scan by ensuring the device is paired and providing instructions. We included this 
      state to reflect the practical steps required before initiating a scan.

    - Transition to "Scanning" occurs when the user starts the scan, moving to the active phase of the process.

Scanning State:
    - This state mirrors the device's "Scanning" state, representing the app's role in monitoring and processing data during 
      the scan.

    - Transition to "Results" occurs upon successful scan completion, while error handling ensures issues are addressed.

Results State:
    - This state displays the results of a completed scan.

    - Transition to "Visualization" allows users to dive deeper into specific metrics, while returning to "Home Page" allows
      the user to naviagte to other areas of the app.

Visualization State:
    - This state provides detailed visualizations of the scan data, such as charts and body maps.

    - Transition back to "Results" maintains the logical flow of information.

Scan History State:
    - This state allows users to view and analyze past scan data. We included it to emphasize the app's ability to store and
      organize historical data.

    - Transition to "Results" lets users revisit the details of specific scans.

Profiles State:
    - This state manages user profiles, allowing users to create, edit, or view existing profiles. We included it to support 
      multi-user functionality and personalized experiences.

    - Transitions to "Edit" and "Create" handle the respective actions, ensuring flexibility in managing profiles.

Error State:
    - This state handles errors during login, registration, or scanning. We included it to reflect robust error handling and 
      provide a clear path for recovery.
