Off State:
    - This state represents when the RaDoTech device is completely powered off. We included this state to reflect 
      the initial and inactive condition of the device.

    - The transition from "Off" to "Idle" occurs when the power on button is pressed, as this mirrors how a real
      world device operates. We added a guard condition [Battery > 0%] to ensure that the device cannot be turned
      on if the battery is completely drained.

    - The transition from "Shutdown" to "Off" allows for both manual and automatic shutdowns. Automatic shutdown
      happens when the battery is completely depleted, while manual shutdown provides the user with control over
      powering off the device.

Idle State:
    - This is the default "ready" state of the device after it powers on. In this state, the device waits for the
      user to initiate an action, such as starting a new scan.

    - We chose to include transitions to "Scanning," "Low Battery," and "Shutdown" from this state because these 
      represent the primary actions a device in standby mode would handle.

    - Transition to "Scanning" occurs when the user starts a scan, provided the device is paired and operational.

    - Transition to "Low Battery" ensures the user is warned if the battery level drops below 25%.

    - Transition to "Shutdown" handles scenarios where the device is manually powered off or the battery is drained.

Scanning State:
    - This state represents the active process of the device performing a health scan. We included it to highlight the
      main functionality of the RaDoTech device.

    - Transition to "Data Transmission" when the scan is completed successfully, reflecting the flow of data to the paired app.

    - Transition to "Error" when the scan fails or produces invalid data, ensuring the user is notified of any issues and can retry.

Data Transmission State:
    - In this state, the device transmits the collected health data to the RaDoTech app for processing. We added this state
      to account for the device's need to interact with the app and reflect the sequence of operations.

    - Transitions to "Idle" when the transmission completes successfully, resetting the device for the next scan.

    - Transitions to "Error" when the transmission fails, prompting the user to address the issue.

Low Battery State:
    - This state represents the device operating with limited functionality due to low power. We included it to emphasize power
      management.

    - Transition to "Shutdown" when the battery is completely depleted, ensuring the device powers off safely to avoid data loss.

    - Transition to "Idle" when the battery is recharged, allowing the device to resume normal functionality.

Error State:
    - This state handles any issues that occur during scanning or data transmission. We included this state to reflect robust error
      handling.

    - The transition back to "Idle" ensures that the device can recover and resume normal operations once the error is resolved.

Shutdown State:
    - This final state represents the device being safely powered down, either manually or automatically. Including this state 
      highlights the device's ability to manage its power gracefully.
